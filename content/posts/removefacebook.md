{{< notice warning >}}
Note that these ADB commands, I am explaining are definitely meant for tech users, an accidental removal of any system app instead of Facebook apps will result bricking your mobile phone and me or our channel is not responsible for any such mistakes.

{{< notice info >}}
In case of unintended removal any system app, please visit nearby brandsâ€™ authorized service center and get the operating system reinstalled on your phone.
